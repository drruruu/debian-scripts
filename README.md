A userscript library for a brand-new kind of Linux distribution.

## Mantra
- Targets [Debian “bullseye”](https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/).
- Installation versions are pinned by-design.
- Script dependencies are only validated.
- Customizations are separated into individual script files.
- Annotated with [PEP 350](https://peps.python.org/pep-0350/) codetags.
