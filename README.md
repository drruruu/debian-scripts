# zim 📚
A userscript library for a brand-new kind of Linux distribution.

## Mantra
`zim` targets [Debian “bullseye”](https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pins installation versions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only validates script dependencies, it does not attempt to resolve them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;isolates component operations into separate script files.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is annotated with [PEP 350](https://peps.python.org/pep-0350/) codetags.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attempts to be careful.
