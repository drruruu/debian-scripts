# zim 📚
A userscript library for a brand-new kind of Linux distribution.

## Mantras
- `zim` targets [Debian “bullseye”](https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/).
- `zim` pins installation version.
- `zim` only validates script dependencies, it does not attempt to resolve them.
- `zim` isolates component operations into separate script files.
- `zim` is annotated with [PEP 350](https://peps.python.org/pep-0350/) codetags.
- `zim` attempts to have fun.
